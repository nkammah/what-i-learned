"What I learned today" app
==========================


Why?
---

This php app is a simple pet project I am using to learn php and explore various aspects of the language.

While I could ( and probably should) use a php framework, I am purposefully using "raw" php, to explore the MVC pattern, Data Mapper pattern and other bits and pieces as they'll come up.

What?
-----

So you finally nailed that "find" command and it took you 10 minutes and you really don't want to look for it again next time - do you save it to a text file? Create an alias? That's what I was doing...until my text file going really busy with tips for vim, textmate, unix commands, php functions...

This app will act as my "text file" and simply provide a way to save/view/search "knowledge bits" or what I learned today.

Now seriously - this is pretty much a blog with backlinks.... 

Roadmap
-------

List of topics I want to explore:
* MVC pattern
* Data Mapper pattern with PDO
* autoloader
* Database testing/mocking
* REST + json interface + testing of REST resources
* filesystem testing ( by providing an option to save to disk "knowledge bits")
* user management
* ...

Disclaimer
----------

I'm very new to php (coming from django) and want to get a good feel of what's possible. At the same time, I want to try as much as possible to follow the "best practices" - as it turns out, it's pretty hard to find a trusted source for that.

I would love it if I could **get feedback** on the choices/design decisions I am making with explanations - isn't it the best way to learn after all?
